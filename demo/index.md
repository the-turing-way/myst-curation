I have put my favourites into a curation [here](#cur-my-favourites).
The MyST Markdown looks like this,

```markdown
:::{curation} My Favourites
---
depth: 2
description: >
  My favourite things in this book.
  Chosen by **me**.
  This description _can_ contain **Markdown** formatting, which is processed by [MyST](https://mystmd.org).
label: cur-my-favourites
---
- animals/cats.md
- cinemas/prince_charles.md
- places/lundy.md
- '#index'
:::
```

And it looks like this.
